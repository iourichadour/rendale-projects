          Julia Wilson Bailey is a registered yoga instructor and holds an M.B.A. from the Darden School of Business. Early in her business 
          career, Julia was drawn to yoga as it brought balance and serenity to her fast-pace lifestyle of banking. In 2003, she completed 
          the Yoga Source Teacher Training Program under the direction of Sandra Pleasants and Jennifer Elliott. Now, as a yoga instructor 
          and executive education facilitator, she strives to create a powerful yet "user-friendly" yoga class which is challenging yet 
          accessible to everyone. She draws on her training from Baron Baptiste and experience in the Iyengar and Ashtanga traditions to create 
          an energetic Power Vinyasa Yoga class. For her, yoga is about personal growth.

          Although she was seduced by yoga and its transformative 
          effects on the body, over the years, she has found that yoga has a transformative effect on our live story as well. She believes "real" 
          yoga happens in our daily lives just as much as it happens "on the mat."
