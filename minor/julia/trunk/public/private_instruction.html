<h2>          private instruction
</h2><p>
          A series of private yoga sessions is a powerful way to deepen and
          strengthen a personal practice.  In a private session, you will
          receive individual attention along with personalized adjustments.
</p><p>
          New to yoga?  In a private yoga session, I can help you determine what
          type of yoga would fit your personality, schedule, and lifestyle.
</p><p>
          Experienced with yoga?  Maybe it is holding headstand or pushing up
          into full wheel.  I can provide adjustments and personalized feedback
          to help shape and deepen your yoga practice.
</p>
<h2>          process
</h2><p>          In order to help you achieve your personal goals for yoga, we will
          first discuss your health history and injury profile as well as your
          prior experience with yoga. After reviewing your health profile and
          experience with yoga, we'll discuss your specific goals for the yoga
          sessions.  From there, we can then create a personalized in-home yoga
          program.
